## Description

A 'simple' mod used for the [MIAFG](http://miafg.com) Evolved Server on Minecraft which adds a few more origins and add the base origins mod allowing them to evolve.
This is the GitHub repository for the MIAFG Server's Evolving Origins Mod, for Fabric (1.19.2).

This mod takes inspiration from:
- [IHasName](https://www.youtube.com/@IHasName)'s Adapted Origins
- [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins)
- The MIAFG Server and its members

If you want to report a bug, please visit [the issue tracker](https://github.com/LarryPlayz/Origins-Evolved-MIAFG/issues).

Also always include the log of your client and the server if possible.

## Plans

### Origins

- [ ] **Pharaoh -** "The spirit of a pharaoh lives on as the undead shadow."
- All zombies become passive
- Every so often you will need to eat rotten flesh
- If your flesh bar reaches zero you will start to die until you eat some rotten flesh or hit any mob
- Villagers will not offer trades to you
- You will gain buffs in a warm biome (eg Desert) and debuff in a cold biome (eg Snowy Plains)
- You can only eat meat (except for bottled items)
- You have 5 extra inventory spaces which do not drop on death
- You have a pocket dimension (only desert biome): no other mobs or players can be sent here, **it is just a world where you can build**
- You can toggle shadow mode (which lasts for 30 seconds)

   - In *Shadow Mode*: You see in a darker tone, you are much faster, you are able to phase into and out of blocks, you are able to become the shadow of a player/mob (mount/ride any mob you right click). This mode lasts for 30 seconds unless interupted; it can be cancelled at any time and recharged when the sun is above you (not blocked by any full blocks).
   - You will have an increased hunger drain while in this mod however and it **will not** kick you out of the toggle if you start taking hunger damage therefore it is important you keep an eye on it. It *will* kick you out of the mode if you take damage from a player.

- [ ] **Valkyrie -**
<!--review charlie's origin when at home-->

- [ ] **Goblin -** 
<!--inchling-esque TBC-->

- [ ] **Vampire -**
<!--possibly - requires feedback from server members-->

- [ ] **Mushroom Dweller -**

- [ ] **and more**

### Evolving Origins

All origins used in this mod (including from the base origins mod) allow you to evolve multiple times - granting you more powers and less debuffs upon each evolution.

**This mod has a unique evolution system requiring multiple steps (3 steps for each evolution level) such as killing the enderdragon to get some of its spirit**

### Items

    - For every origin
    - Gives the player an advancement (current idea) / custom tree (if i can) and evolves their current origin to the next level (if the potion is made correctly) 
- Mushroom Cap (helmet slot)
    - For Mushroom Dweller
    - Prevents the player from wearing a helmet
- Crown (helmet slot)
