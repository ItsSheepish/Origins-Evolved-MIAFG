Before anything I want to say this is my first mod, and I am working through at a slow pace to add all the features I want, this is meant for a small server of friends. I am following tutorials by Modding by Kaupenjoe adding features which I choose. Thanks, Sheepish.

## Description

A 'simple' mod used for the [MIAFG](http://miafg.com) Evolved Server on Minecraft which adds a few more origins and add the base origins mod allowing them to evolve.
This is the GitHub repository for the MIAFG Server's Evolving Origins Mod, for Fabric (1.19.2).

This mod takes inspiration from:
- [IHasName](https://www.youtube.com/@IHasName)'s Adapted Origins
- [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins)
- The MIAFG Server and its members

If you want to report a bug, please visit [the issue tracker](https://github.com/LarryPlayz/Origins-Evolved-MIAFG/issues). Make sure to check other existing issues first, and post detailed information about which mods and which version you are using, what you would expect to happen, and what happens instead. Also, always include the log of your client and the server if possible.

## Plans

### Origins

<details>
<summary>Pharaoh</summary>

>"The spirit of a pharaoh lives on as the undead shadow."

+ All zombies become passive
+ Every so often you will need to eat rotten flesh
+ If your flesh bar reaches zero you will start to die until you eat some rotten flesh or hit any mob
+ Villagers will not offer trades to you
+ You will gain buffs in warm biomes (e.g. Desert) and debuffs in cold biomes (e.g. Snowy Plains)
+ You can only eat meat (except for bottled items)
+ You have 5 extra inventory spaces which do not drop on death
+ You can toggle shadow mode (which lasts for 30 seconds)

   - In *Shadow Mode*: You see in a darker tone, you are much faster, you are able to phase into and out of blocks, you are able to become the shadow of a player/mob (mount/ride any mob you right-click). This mode lasts for 30 seconds unless interrupted; it can be cancelled at any time and recharged when the sun is above you (not blocked by any full blocks).
   - You will have an increased hunger drain while in this mode and you **will not** be kicked out of the toggle if you start taking hunger damage therefore it is important you keep an eye on it. It *will* kick you out of the mode if you take damage from a player.
