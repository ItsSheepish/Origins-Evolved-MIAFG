## Plans

### Origins

**Pharaoh -** An origin which allows you to switch in and out of *Shadow Mode*.
- All zombies become passive
- Every so often you will need to eat rotten flesh
- If your flesh bar reaches zero you will start to die until you eat some rotten flesh or hit any mob
- Villagers will not offer trades to you
- You will gain buffs in a warm biome (eg Desert) and debuff in a cold biome (eg Snowy Plains)
- You can only eat meat (except for bottled items)
- You have 5 extra inventory spaces which do not drop on death
- You have a pocket dimension (only desert biome): no other mobs or players can be sent here, **it is just a world where you can build**
- You can toggle shadow mode (which lasts for 30 seconds): You gain speed 3, can phase into blocks and ride mobs (without control)

In *Shadow Mode*: You see in a darker tone, you are much faster, you are able to phase into and out of blocks, you are able to become the shadow of a player/mob (mount/ride any mob you right click). This mode lasts for 30 seconds unless interupted; it can be cancelled at any time and recharged when the sun is above you.

>**Valkyrie -** 

### Evolving Origins

All origins used in this mod (including from the base origins mod) allow you to evolve multiple times granting you more powers and less debuffs
